# CORS Configuration Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved
The frontend running on `http://localhost:3002` was being blocked by CORS policy when trying to access the backend API at `http://127.0.0.1:8008`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Backend Configuration Updated
**File**: `backend/.env`
```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001", "http://localhost:3002", "http://127.0.0.1:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3001", "http://127.0.0.1:3002", "http://localhost:5173", "http://127.0.0.1:5173"]
```

### 2. Vite Proxy Configuration Added
**File**: `frontend/vite.config.ts`
```typescript
server: {
  port: 3000,
  open: true,
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8008',
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
    },
  },
},
```

### 3. Backend Restarted
The backend server was restarted to apply the new CORS settings.

## Test Results ✅
- ✅ Backend health check: Working
- ✅ CORS from localhost:3000: Allowed
- ✅ CORS from localhost:3002: Allowed
- ✅ Preflight OPTIONS requests: Working

## Current Status
- **Backend**: Running at http://127.0.0.1:8008
- **Frontend (main)**: Running at http://localhost:3000
- **Frontend (alt)**: Running at http://localhost:3002
- **API Documentation**: Available at http://127.0.0.1:8008/docs

## How to Use
The frontend can now make API requests directly to the backend without CORS errors:
- Direct requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8008/*`
- Or use the proxy path `/api/*` which forwards to the backend

The CORS issue has been completely resolved and the system is ready for use.
